## A website showcasing my web development abilities.

Every web developer needs to be able to show what they are able to do. Why are you the one deserving of this job position? What can yo do better?

I built, and will continue to add onto this project as I further my learning journey, to display the skills I've accrued thus far. As my armamentarium of web developing techniques grow, I will show my own evolution that can be tracked with this project.

I hope that with my background of dentistry, I can use both sets of skills to create websites that give patients more information about what dentistry really is, not just something to be feared or dreaded. I also hope that I can help dentists improve the way they keep electronic health records (EHR) to be able to take both legal notes and notes just for the dental team (i.e., does the patient prefer music, a blanket, do they want you to talk or be silent through the procedure?).

As I was building this HTML and CSS code, I learned that I still have much to learn, and to get comfortable with. My goals as I grow into this position as a web developer include being able to stay organized in both files, naming elements/classes/IDs concisely and precisely, and becoming more familiar with esthetic design using just CSS.
